# SUMMARY: Earthquakes and Fault Lines
In this demo I use the Leaflet mapping plugin to create interactive maps showing both United States fault lines. I have only plotted the fault-lines which have the following slip_rate values: Greater than 5.0 mm/yr and Between 1.0 and 5.0 mm/yr. A higher stroke-weight is used for fault-lines with higher slip_rates.

The maps includes a number of base maps to choose from, as well as overlays for the earthquake and fault-line data that can be turned on and off independently. These layers can toggled from a layer control.

Each quake or fault line on the map includes a popup providing additional information when clicked.

# DATA:
Earthquake data is pulled from: 
US GeoJSON Fee, Past 30 Days M1.0+ Earthquakes: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

Fault Data is from a csv file of faultline records.

# RESULTS:
TODO ADD PICTURES AND DESCRIPTIONS
